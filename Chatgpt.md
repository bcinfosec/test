### **Updated API Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing Roadmap**

#### **1. Expanded Technical Testing Procedures**

##### **A. REST API-Specific Tests**

1. **Authentication and Authorization**:
    
    - Validate token-based systems (e.g., JWT, OAuth 2.0).
    - Attempt privilege escalation.
    - Test expired, revoked, and invalid tokens.
2. **Input Validation**:
    
    - Test against OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities (SQL Injection, XSS, Command Injection).
    - Perform fuzz testing on query parameters, headers, and JSON payloads.
3. **Rate Limiting and Throttling**:
    
    - Simulate repeated requests to test for rate-limiting protections.
    - Check error responses for rate-limit triggers.
4. **Error Handling**:
    
    - Review HTTP status codes (e.g., 500 errors revealing stack traces).
    - Look for sensitive data exposure in error responses.
5. **Data Validation**:
    
    - Analyze content-type headers.
    - Validate API response structures (e.g., JSON Schema validation).
6. **Caching Issues**:
    
    - Verify proper use of `Cache-Control` and `ETag` headers.
    - Confirm sensitive data is not stored in caches.
7. **Session Management**:
    
    - Test for improper session expiration and hijacking risks.
    - Assess `Secure`, `HttpOnly`, and `SameSite` cookie attributes.
8. **CORS Misconfigurations**:
    
    - Evaluate `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` headers for over-permissive domains.

### **File Upload Vulnerability Assessment**

#### **1. Testing Scenarios**

##### **A. File Type Validation**

1. **Case**: Attempt to upload files with invalid extensions.
    - Expected Result: Only allow specific file types (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`, `.pdf`).
    - Tools: Burp Suite (modify Content-Type headers).
2. **Case**: Upload files with altered MIME types (e.g., `.exe` with a `.png` extension).
    - Expected Result: The system detects and rejects mismatched MIME types.

##### **B. File Size Restrictions**

1. **Case**: Upload a file exceeding the maximum allowed size.
    - Expected Result: Return an appropriate HTTP error code (e.g., 413 Payload Too Large).
2. **Case**: Upload very small files to check for zero-byte file handling.
    - Expected Result: Reject zero-byte uploads.

##### **C. Content Inspection**

1. **Case**: Upload malicious payloads embedded in files (e.g., scripts within images or documents).
    - Expected Result: System scans the content and rejects malicious files.
    - Tools: ClamAV, YARA rules.

##### **D. Path Traversal**

1. **Case**: Include directory traversal patterns in the file name (e.g., `../../etc/passwd`).
    - Expected Result: Application sanitizes inputs and stores files securely.

##### **E. Upload Storage**

1. **Case**: Attempt to access uploaded files directly via their URL.
    - Expected Result: Uploaded files should not be accessible without authentication and authorization.
2. **Case**: Analyze upload locations for temporary storage vulnerabilities (e.g., `/tmp`).

##### **F. File Overwriting**

1. **Case**: Upload a file with the same name as an existing file.
    - Expected Result: The system should rename the new file to prevent overwriting or generate a unique file name.

##### **G. Permissions and Execution**

1. **Case**: Check if uploaded files can be executed on the server.
    - Expected Result: Uploaded files should not have executable permissions.
2. **Case**: Test for improperly configured `Content-Disposition` headers that could lead to file download instead of execution.

##### **H. Handling Encrypted Files**

1. **Case**: Upload password-protected or encrypted files.
    - Expected Result: Application should reject such files if it cannot inspect the contents.

---

#### **2. Best Practices for File Upload Security**

1. **File Type and Size Validation**
    
    - Use a whitelist approach for allowed file types.
    - Set strict size limits and implement server-side checks.
    - Validate both file extension and MIME type.
2. **Content Filtering**
    
    - Scan uploaded files with antivirus tools.
    - Inspect files for embedded scripts or malicious payloads.
3. **Secure Storage**
    
    - Store uploaded files outside the web root directory.
    - Use randomized file names to prevent enumeration.
    - Apply encryption for sensitive file storage.
4. **Permissions**
    
    - Restrict read/write/execute permissions on upload directories.
    - Enforce access controls for downloading/viewing files.
5. **Server-Side Validation**
    
    - Perform validation and sanitization on the server, not just the client.
    - Reject files containing special characters or directory traversal patterns.
6. **Monitoring and Logging**
    
    - Log all file upload activities, including metadata (e.g., IP address, user ID).
    - Monitor for unusual upload patterns or repeated upload attempts.
7. **Rate Limiting**
    
    - Implement rate limits for file uploads to mitigate DoS attacks.
